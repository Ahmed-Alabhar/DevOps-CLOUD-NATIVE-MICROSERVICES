### PROJECT DELIVERABLES
Students are expected to deliver the following artifacts as part of the capstone project:
- A fully functional cloud-native e-commerce application deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.
- A well-structured CI/CD pipeline that automates the testing and deployment process.
- Monitoring and observability infrastructure, including Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
- GitOps workflows that enable automated deployments and configuration management.
- Operational procedures, including incident response runbooks and post-incident reviews.
- Comprehensive documentation covering the architecture, workflows, developer guides, and best practices.

**Evaluation:** The capstone project will be evaluated based on the completeness of the application, adherence to best practices, effective use of DevOps tools and techniques, and the quality of documentation. Students will also be assessed on their ability to respond to simulated incidents and conduct post-incident reviews.

**Collaboration:** The capstone project encourages collaboration among students, mimicking real-world scenarios where DevOps teams work together to build and manage complex applications. Students are encouraged to share insights, seek assistance, and participate in collaborative development and troubleshooting.

**Mentorship:** Throughout the capstone project, students will have access to mentors and instructors who can provide guidance, answer questions, and offer assistance as needed. This mentorship ensures that students can overcome challenges and successfully complete the project.

The Capstone Project serves as the ultimate test of the students' skills and knowledge, providing them with a hands-on, real-world experience in DevOps. It reinforces the importance of collaboration, best practices, and operational excellence in modern software development and deployment.
